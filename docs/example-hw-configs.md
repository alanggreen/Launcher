# Example Hardware Configurations

We've prepared some example hardware configurations to demonstrate how you might equip your tournament, and how the various computers are used and connected to each other.

## Small competition

A scrimmage or low-resource competition could run using a single laptop.

* The projector would be connected to the extended display output on the laptop.
* The venue sound system would be connected to the laptop audio output.
* Open 4 browser tabs
  1. Scoresheet
  1. Timer
  1. Scoreboard (moved to extended display)
  1. Tournament (admin only)

## Mid-sized competition

A mid-sized comptition with two computers might look like this:

* Video and audio connections same as [Small competition](#small-competition)
* Software installed on one computer, only a browser used on 2nd computer
* On 1st computer, open 4 browser tabs (right computer in image)
  1. Scoresheet
  1. Timer (could be on 2nd computer instead)
  1. Scoreboard (moved to extended display)
  1. Tournament (admin only)
* On 2nd computer, open 2 browser tabs (left computer in image)
  1. Scoresheet
  1. Timer (could be on 1st computer instead)

## Large competition

A large or well-resourced competition could have 4 computers. A router is required to connect the computers into a network. Some or all the computers could use WiFi for connectivity.

<img src="./images/4 computers.png" style="width:75%">

* Software installed on one computer (head ref computer), only browsers are used on the other computers.
* 1st and 2nd computers are used for Scorekeepers and Timer
  1. Open browser tab for scoresheet
  1. Open browser tab for Timer (either on 1st or 2nd computer)
* On 3rd computer (for Head Ref), open 2 browser tabs
  1. Scoring (to monitor scores)
  1. Tournament (admin only)
  1. Audio cable connected to this computer
* On 4th computer, open 1 browser tab
  1. Scoreboard
  
## Large competition with iPads or tablets

Same configuration as [Large Competition](#large-competition) except that iPads are used by referees for score entry.

Note: Since this software is still new and we don't have sufficient experience recording the match results on iPads only, we suggest that you use papers scoresheets in addition to the digital scoresheets.

The two scorekeeper computers are unnecessary if score entry is done on iPads only.

If score entry is done on iPads and paper scoresheets then scorekeepers can verify that the paper and digital scoresheets are consistent.
